<p>
Topics and things I enjoy learning about and screwing around in within the computational world: 
<ul>
  <li> functional programming (Scala, baby) </li>
  <li> deep learning (mainly via the Theano framework although I am very interested by Google’s TensorFlow)</li>
  <li> backend web development (I built this site using NodeJS + Express like all the other cool kids)</li>
  <li> machine learning more generally (from time to time I’ll throw some Python at a Kaggle competition)</li>
</ul>
</p>

Outside of work, one of the biggest activities I enjoy is this nebulous thing called “fitness”.  I go to the gym 3 times a week in the mornings.  Squats, bench, and deadlifts.  It’s all about the pump, as Arnold would say.   Really though, I am usually up for any physical activity—be it bike riding, rock climbing, yoga, swimming, or whatever.  I also try running when I can so my cardio is not absolutely terrible.  I started lifting to look good, but, at this point, I just do it because it’s fun and a good way to clear my mind from a job existing within almost purely within the realms of the entirely logical and predictable.

I also enjoy doing some creative writing in my free time when I am alone and have not much else to do.  Usually this involves settling upon some random, but interesting or provocative prompt and going with it, wherever that may lead.  Writing a novel is definitely something I want to do someday even if no one reads it.  We’ll see.

I am also fulfilling my long delayed goal of picking up a musical instrument.  I continuously played the guitar for like 3 months straight before being swamped by grad school.  I am picking that up again and doing guitar classes in the city.

And, of course, it’s New York City.  So, like 95% of the people here, I find myself often drinking at some awful / great bar with my fellow aged 20-something friends on weekends or staying in watching Netflix because my face hurts from the cold.
