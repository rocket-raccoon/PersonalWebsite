<h1>Sports</h1>

<p>
Besides school, I was always involved in some kind of sport growing up.  I was a pretty average soccer player in elementary school, mainly due to my asthma problems.  Thankfully, I grew out of asthma as I got older.  From late elementary to early high school, I was involved in Kenpo Karate.  In high school, I played a little football although I was too scrawny to be of any real use at the time.  It wasnâ€™t until I started lifting weights sometime sophomore year and started wrestling that changed.

The sports I follow nowadays are basketball, football, and mixed martial arts mainly.  In basketball, my favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers.  In football, my favorite teams are the San Francisco 49er's and the San Diego (soon to be Los Angeles) Chargers.  In mixed martial arts, I don't really have a favorite fighter, persay, although Conor McGregor is extremely entertaining.
