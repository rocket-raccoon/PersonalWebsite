I then moved to New York City because “why the hell not?” seemed like a perfectly valid reason at the time (still does, actually).  I got a job working as a data scientist at Match Media Group, which owns many beloved online dating sites like OkCupid and Tinder.  According to Glassdoor’s ‘”25 Best Jobs in America”, data scientist is number 1 so that’s nice.

However, I really missed suffering through my math and computer science classes and needed to be abused just one last time.  I ended up getting my master’s degree in computer science at Columbia University.  Being student poor in NYC while trying to make the last of your savings from your previous job stretch as far as possible was quite the experience.

Now, I work at Shutterstock, where I help solve interesting search related problems using statistical machine learning tools.  My job title is officially “Big Data Engineer”, but I think the “Big” is a little excessive so I’ll just go by Data Engineer or Data Scientist even.
