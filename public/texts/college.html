<h1>College</h1>

<p>
I went to Stanford University in 2008.  I initially considered being an English major because writing has always been something special to me and reading literary classics was basically how I spent my summers as a high school kid.  But reality is a stern mistress.  I figured I should do that as a hobby and instead do something more lucrative.  I fell into Management Science and Engineering, which is basically an amalgam of finance, operations research, and general engineering.  I realized that calculating dollar values in spreadsheets was not the most terribly exciting thing in the world and so I switched into the Mathematical & Computational Science major even though I was pretty much already done with the prior major. I finally graduated with dual majors in both these things in the spring of 2012.
