<p>
My name is Alberto.  Sometimes I introduce myself as Albert because it saves a syllable.  In Spanish, people call me Beto.  Take your pick!

My story really begins a while ago, long before my birth.  It was in 1979 that one could mark the beginning of the Salvadoran Civil War, the details of which are really not that special for a third world country often ensnared in these kinds of bloody affairs.  My father was 17 at the time, living in a lush rural area with a partial high school education and not much to his name.  After experiencing first hand the seemingly never-ending violence and deaths around him, he immigrated to Mexico to avoid being drafted into a probable death by guerilleros fighting against an oppressive government regime.

It was there he met my mother and started a life together.  My mother is from the state of Chihuahua (yes, like the dog), which is basically straight south of Texas.  Not long after, they made the important decision to immigrate one more country up and come to the United States in 1983.  The San Francisco 49erâ€™s were pretty amazing at the time and my parents have been fans ever since!

I had the good fortune to be born in 1990 in Los Angeles, CA, avoiding much of the relative poverty and lack of opportunity my parents had to face.  I was raised my entire life in Southern California, instilled with my parents undying belief that with proper education and hard work one could make anything of themselves in this country.  So yeah school was always a very big deal in my household, from me down to my younger brother and sister.
